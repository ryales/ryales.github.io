            <h1>Police & Prison Law</h1>
              <hr></hr>
              <p>The internal security forces of Saint-Domingue were divided between urban and rural. The term police referred to the troops in the colony’s towns, while maréchausée was used for those serving in the rural areas. In the towns, the police force consisted of a small number of Inspectors dependent on the community’s size, with an exempt and several sergeants and officers below him. Their main tasks were to patrol the streets, prevent theft and fraud, and keep the peace. The laws outlining their orders pay particular attention to checking the quality of meat at the butcheries, which had to be examined every morning, and to assure the orderliness of market days.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> But most of all, they were instructed by the colony’s Intendants and Councils to be constantly on the lookout for slaves who were not where they were supposed to be or who were doing something they were not supposed to do.</p>

              <p>The second internal force was the maréchausée, or the rural police. They were named after a similar force in France whose members were dedicated to protecting rural estates from bandits and chasing down deserters. Stewart King notes, however, that the duties of the Saint-Domingue maréchausée were again largely focused on the pursuit of runaways and the enforcement of slave law. They had focused on breaking up maroon bands and settlements early in the colony’s history, but these had all but disappeared by the time of Les Affiches Américaines. The maréchausée were almost solely comprised of men of African descent – with the exception of the top-ranking officials – which allowed for a unique armed class within the gens de couleur.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref2">2</a></sup>  Together, the police and maréchausée of Saint-Domingue were probably the most common arrestors of slaves en marronage.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref3">3</a></sup></p>

              <p>Because the most important tasks for the police forces were to enforce the slave laws, it is important to discuss what types of violations they watched for while on duty. Knowing the laws and regulations for slaves, particularly as they refer to marronage, allows greater understanding of the type of people who were imprisoned in the prisons épaves. Slaves’ behavior was very restrictive, especially outside his or her owner’s property. No slave was to be out past 10 o’clock in the evening without his master – and any slave without a lantern at night was immediately brought to the prisons because the act automatically indicated a desire for deceit. Slaves away from their masters for any reason were to carry with them at all times a billet, which was a document signed by their master stating his or her permission for the slave to be travelling or working away from the master’s property. These billets could be demanded from the slave by any white colonist and were only allowed to give the slave leave to gone for a week and no more.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref4">4</a></sup> Many other regulations existed, but these are the ones of most interest as their violations resulted in imprisonment as a maroon.</p>

              <p>Once brought to the prison, the Receveur des Épaves recorded the slave’s information. He wrote in the Registre du Greffe the incoming slave’s name, nation, brand, age, signalement (identifying features or description), and owner’s name. He was also to turn over a proper and complete report of this information each week to the printer of Les Affiches Américaines and send it to the local parish to be posted on the door. If he did not do so or was not careful to record good information, and the slave was sold at public auction as unclaimed property and the owner complained, the Receveur was to be held personally liable for the cost of the slave to the previous owner.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref5">5</a></sup> This provided a good incentive to follow the law to the letter, meaning that the prison lists of Les Affiches Américaines are always published, with hardly a single issue going without it.</p>
