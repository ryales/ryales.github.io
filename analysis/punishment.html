            <h1>Punishment</h1>
              <hr></hr>
              <p>The prison lists and advertisements offer insight into the reasons for marronage, and from that, the treatment of slaves in Saint-Domingue. Two main explanations of marronage are put forth by Gabriel Debien: bad treatment (corporal punishment, cruelty, rape) of slaves, usually by the manager rather than the owner, and a lack of food or decent living conditions.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> While the newspapers do not often explicitly mention reasons for escape, some ads and prison lists provide information that give evidence to support these reasons for marronage. Many slaves have indications of multiple punishments, and sometimes even fresh wounds will be described. Other slaves are described as emaciated, or are mentioned as being sick. These all point to why the slaves might have ran away from their owner’s property. Because of this, the role of punishment in marronage is looked at in detail here.</p>
              
              <p>In the lists and ads examined, 101 slaves <em>en marronage</em> had indications of punishment. Noting this attribute, however, was only done in the secondary data collection, and so only covers the 3,206 slaves from advertisements and prison lists from 1766-1768.  Though this number does not include the later 1780s period, it is surprisingly low (~3%) given that physical punishment was not an extraordinary occurrence in Saint-Domingue.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref2">2</a></sup> But even though physical brutality was commonplace in the colony, jailers were not required to note every scar and bruise. As discussed previously, the descriptive requirements were limited to identifying features, not general descriptions. The jail officials followed these requirements quite accurately, and so the newspaper only reported instances of severe or rare punishment, or those punishments which were designed to be signifiers of certain behavior to other colonists and to the owner.</p>

              <p>The types of punishments that are mentioned in the ads and prison lists are terribly cruel. They are profound examples of the brutal force that colonists felt was necessary to control and subdue the majority slave population. Of the 101 identified, 13 have marks or scars from a whip, 15 have severed ears (10 with both missing and 5 with only one missing), 1 whose hamstring has been severed, 1 whose head has contusions from being beat with a baton, 1 with a broken arm, 3 with a fleur-de-lis mark, and 73 who have escaped or were imprisoned with some sort of iron chain, collar, or weight. Jacques, a Saint-Domingue creole owned by a free mulâtresse baker in Cap-Français, was brought to the Fort-Dauphin prison with a scarred back, an iron collar, and no ears, showing that many of these unfortunate men and women bore several of these markers simultaneously.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref3">3</a></sup>   A whipping or beating might be followed up with chains to restrict movement and ostracize the slave as a trouble maker.</p>

              <p>That these punishments were the result of troublesome or rebellious behavior is largely the reason why Les Affiches Américaines bothered to publish these descriptions. Jailers and registry officials wanted to locate owners quickly to avoid fines and collect fees. To do so, they were to provide identifying descriptors to supplement the name, age, brand, and owner. They sent information about corporal punishment and iron chains to the newspaper because those markers indicated the past behavior of the slave, making the slave easier to identify. The Code Noir dictated that a runaway slave who has been recaptured “shall have his ears cut off and shall be branded with a fleur de lys on one shoulder.” If he flees again, “he shall have his hamstring cut and be branded with a fleur de lys on the other shoulder.”<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref4">4</a></sup> Therefore, slave owners reading that a slave has a fleur-de-lis or cut-off ears, even if the slave refuses to cooperate, can still identify the prisoner based off that information and the brand. In addition, any slave who has run off with a nabot (iron weight) or chain around his ankle has already been noted as a “problem” slave by his owner, and thus will be more quickly identified – both by anyone who sees him off his plantation and when mentioned in the prison lists. The rarity with which the Code Noir punishments seem to have been meted out, at least based off the documents in Les Affiches Américaines from this time period, also means that any runaway appearing with evidence of them will be very quickly identified.</p>

              <p>Also important to note about punishments of slaves, is that the relative rarity of these punitive actions in the prison lists and ads is evidence of Gabriel Debien’s position that slave owners in Saint-Domingue were more practical in their infliction of punishment than what the law dictated. Debien also points out that the mandated punishments were often ignored for nouveau slaves, and this is supported in the prison lists.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref5s">5</a></sup> Only two of the slaves with punishment markers were nouveau. Both had iron collars around their necks and could not even name their masters, indicating that their collars might be from their slave ship or auction and not in fact evidence of punishment for an infraction. Inflicting permanent physical punishment on newly arrived slaves did more harm than good for slave owners.</p>

              <p>Further, Debien states that the Code Noir mandated punishments were not followed even for repeat offenders.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref6">6</a></sup> And this is the case for Florentine, a Mina slave who ran away in 1766 and 1767. She is wearing a collar and chain the first time she is imprisoned in the spring of 1766, but after slipping away during the Christmas season the following winter and being caught again, there is no indication of severed ears or the fleur-de-lis. This may be explained, however, by the fact that she does not seem to have left Cap-Français or to have been gone for very long. And even la Fortune, who left his master Michel Taris, a carpenter in Cap-Français, three different times over a year and an half, does not appear to have received any permanent punishment. The third time he does have a nabot around his ankle, but that seems to be the extent of his restrictions. His carpentry skill probably deterred Taris from selling or permanently maiming him. Plantation slaves, however, were not so lucky.</p>

              <p>Though the sample is small, it is worth noting that none of the slaves with the Code Noir punishments are noted to have a skill or to have belonged to an urban owner. The data is not significant enough to make any sure conclusion, but it fits with the argument that slaves on the plantations received more ill-treatment and were dealt with more harshly due to their continual replacement.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref7">7</a></sup> Debien’s conclusion that the most severe corporal punishments were not usually implemented seem to be supported by the prison lists and ads in Les Affiches Américaines, though a more complete collection of punishment data through the 1770s and 1780s will solidify this argument. It would be particularly interesting to see if the indications of Code Noir punishments decrease over time, or if they increase as the population of African slaves in the colony increases.</p>
