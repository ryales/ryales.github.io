            <h1>Spatial Distribution</h1>
              <hr></hr>
              <p>One of the most interesting ways in which to analyze the maroons of Saint-Domingue is to see how they are moving throughout the colony. The laws discussed earlier make it clear that slaves were not to have any sort of freedom of movement, yet the slaves en marronage travel the roads, visit relatives, and seek new lives. Tracing their movements can provide insight into what sort of options slaves had to resist their captivity and how they traversed their environment. </p>
              <img class="roundrect" src="../img/locIDCircles [Converted].png"</img>
                <p>Figure 1.1</p>
              <p>Some slaves captured and taken to the prisons were simply shirking work and planning on being gone for a few days. But others were intent on escaping enslavement for good. Using the arrest locations from the prison lists, an estimate can be reached as to how many slaves were attempting the latter goal. Figure 1.1 shows the various locations of arrests for those entering the Cap-Français and Fort-Dauphin prisons throughout the sample period (though most come from the 1780s). The reason the whole colony is not shown is because the southern and western jurisdictions did not report arrest locations in the newspaper. The arrests are focused in two areas: Spanish Santo Domingo and the large city of Cap-Français.</p>

              <p>Approximately 20% of all arrests (3,671) took place in Spanish territory. This is a significant proportion and is the most obvious indicator of those slaves who had no intention of ever returning to Saint-Domingue and their masters. Santo Domingo was a desirable location for slaves of Saint-Domingue because there was more open land and less people – the population density was about 6.5 times higher on the French side of Hispaniola and was much less cultivated.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> This meant that fugitive slaves would have a better chance to start a new life undetected.</p>

              <p>The French administrators were unhappy with this reality, however, and attempted to better reclaim their fugitive property “who have passed and pass daily into the Spanish Part”<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref2">2</a></sup> by offering extensive rewards. In April of 1776, the French struck a deal with the Spanish regarding the return of runaways. For every French maroon returned to a French prison from Santo-Domingo, 200 livres would be paid regardless of age, sex, or distance travelled. This permanent bounty was in addition to the smaller reward that was based on distance and number of people and horses involved in order to ensure as many returns of French runaways as possible.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref3">3</a></sup></p>

              <p>The other main region for arrests was the area around Cap-Français. The four locations of the city, la Fossette (the site of slave auctions), Haut-du-Cap (the town just south of the city), and the parish of Petite-Anse (the central section of the Plaine du Nord south of the city) made up another 17% of arrests. The intentions of the slaves captured here are more ambiguous, as some may have been planning to blend into the city for good, others may simply have been visiting for the day, and still more might have been nouveaux slaves running at the first opportunity from the harbor or the auctions – making easy targets for police. Only 36 of those 620 arrested slaves were reported as nouveaux, however, which limits the viability of the last option. But the size and population of the city (nearly 19,000 in 1789) still makes it difficult to read their intentions. The pull of the city’s entertainments, large free colored population, and the anonymity that it offered would have been very attractive to plantation slaves laboring in the Northern Plain.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref4">4</a></sup></p> 

              <p>An analysis of arrest locations from the prison lists offers an estimation of how many slaves were intent on grand marronage and speaks to the tension between the French and Spanish colonies sharing the island. Slaves seem to have headed in one of two major directions when en marronage. Many made for the mountains in the south side of the Northern Part. They would then make their way across the border into Spanish Santo Domingo. The other major trend was to escape to the city to hide among the crowds of slaves and free people of color. It is not certain just from location what each slave’s intention was, but greater knowledge of where the slave’s owner was located would help create a more accurate picture. The prison lists from the 1780s which have arrest locations are less likely to report the owner’s location, however, meaning that it would involve extensive research and examination of records to locate them all.</p>
