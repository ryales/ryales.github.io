            <h1>Les Affiches Américaines</h1>
            <hr></hr>
              <p>	<em>Les Affiches Américaines</em> was the colony’s only major newspaper throughout its run from January 1766 to December 1790. Its predecessor, entitled <em>Gazette de Saint-Domingue</em>, was authored by Sr. Monceaux in Cap-Français in early 1764, but only ran until August. Within three weeks, however, the printer Antoine Marie began publishing <em>Les Affiches Américaines</em>. The royal patent he had received that winter gave him the exclusive rights to print and sell in the colony.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> Although the paper usually had several small news pieces on Europe and the Americas, the majority of the publication consisted of shipping and trade information from the colony’s ports, advertisements, death notices, and letters from colonists around the island. Marie’s “American Notices” may have been more of a local bulletin than a full newspaper, but eight pages were printed twice every week (with later years publishing supplementary sections), and colonial administrators often used it as a way to spread information around the colony, making it quite useful for historians today.</p>

              <p>Several sections of <em>Les Affiches Américaines</em> were actually required by administrative order. For example, deaths of important individuals and colonists’ departures for France were required to be placed in the paper. The most important, at least for purposes here, is the requirement for the paper’s printer to include a list of all <em>nègres en marronage</em> who had entered the prison that week. In February of 1764, the Intendant of Saint-Domingue, René Magon, wrote a letter instructing each jurisdiction to require their jailers every week to submit a list of the <em>Negres Marrons</em> that had entered the jail. Though this order was for the Gazette de Saint-Domingue, the requirement held for Les Affiches Américaines when it succeeded the Gazette. Slave owners had found previous lists so helpful that Magon felt it was necessary to continue their publication.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref2">2</a></sup></p>

              <p>With that order, the prison lists became a standard feature of Saint-Domingue newspapers. Every issue, the <em>Nègres en Marronage</em> section reported descriptions of each slave brought to the prisons epâves around the colony since the last reporting. The 1764 order required the name, nation, brand, and age to be published. This allowed the owner to recognize his or her slave.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref3">3</a></sup> These prisons were located throughout the colony. In the north were those of Cap-Français, Fort-Dauphin, and Port-de-Paix. The western part had the prisons of Saint-Marc, Port-au-Prince, Léogane, and Jacmel. And those in the southern part of the colony were located in Saint-Louis, Cayes, and Jérémie. Prisons did exist wherever the police or maréchausée were established, but slaves were usually transferred from the small parish prisons to ones in the larger towns. A few of the early lists from the 1760s indicate such transfers in <em>Les Affiches Américaines</em>.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref4">4</a></sup></p>

              <p>The prison lists, because of their required publication, offer a more complete picture of <em>marronage</em> in the colony than runaway advertisements. Saint-Domingue is often described as having two types of marronage: <em>grand</em> and <em>petit</em>. The first was what traditionally comes to mind when envisioning a runaway slave. These men and women have left for good, with no intention of returning – their goal is to blend into the free population or to flee the jurisdiction entirely (Spanish Santo Domingo was a common destination). <em>Petit marronage</em>, on the other hand, is more temporary. These slaves may only desire to disappear for a few days or a week, seeking a respite from their labors and then returning.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref5">5</a></sup> The runaway advertisements, because of the cost, usually only contain instances of <em>grand marronage</em> where the slave has been gone a significant period of time, or <em>petit marronage</em> from owners who live near the place of publication. The prison lists, however, contain every slave who is captured suspected of <em>marronage</em>, meaning both <em>grand</em> and <em>petit</em> maroons are included regardless of where their owner lives or how long they have been gone, from a few hours to several years.</p>
              
              <p>This is not to say that every slave <em>en marronage</em> is included in the prison lists. Some were never caught, and either passed for free, left the colony, or returned of their own volition to their masters. Others were caught very close to their owners’ homes, and brought immediately back by neighbors or police forces. And even once placed in the prison, slaves might have been reclaimed so quickly that they were not reported in the following week’s paper. There is really no way to tell exactly how many slaves participated in marronage at this time, but Jason Daniels has indicated it may be possible with a thorough examination of colonial plantation records cross-examined with prison lists and runaway advertisements. But despite all this, the prison lists currently give the best approximation of marronage numbers.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref6">6</a></sup></p>

              <p>The reality is that not every slave <em>en marronage</em> was imprisoned or caught, which requires a discussion about how the slaves that did end up in these prisons came to be there. To begin with, the most common reason for imprisonment for slaves was due to <em>marronage</em>.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref7">7</a></sup> Specific sections of the colony’s jails were set aside for this purpose, and they were called <em>les prisons epâves</em>. The term <em>epâve</em> refers to lost or unclaimed property, which captured runaways were until returned to their masters. As unclaimed property, they were still valuable to their owners, who wanted to reclaim them and get them back to work as soon as possible. The colonial administration therefore provided a service to slave owners by employing police to patrol the colony for slaves <em>en marronage</em> and bring them to the prisons to be reclaimed.</p>
