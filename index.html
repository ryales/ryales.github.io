            Project Summary
          </h2>
          <p>
            Basically, this project involves databasing thousands of prison lists describing runaway slaves in 18th century Saint-Domingue. It also attempted to create an accurate historical geography for the colony using GIS technology. The database and GIS were then united with scholarly research to analyze and draw conclusions about marronage and geography in Saint-Domingue.

          <p>
            My name is Rachel Yales and I am a history undergrad student at Michigan State University. I wanted to finish off my undergrad career with something digital, and so I decided to make my senior thesis project online. In addition to my work here, I've also been planning some epic post-grad travels.

            Collaboration
          </h2>
          <p>
            I could never have been able to do all of this on my own, and so I want to say a few thank yous. One in particular to Professor Gwendolyn Midlo Hall, who advised me throughout this project and has always been incredibly supportive. Also to Professors Walter Hawthorne, Ethan Watrall, and Paul Lachance, who have always been willing to give me advice on how to proceed. And to the Honors College and History Department at MSU, both of which awarded scholarships to help make this project great. Also to my friend, Rebecca Kiefer, who helped enter the data this past summer!
